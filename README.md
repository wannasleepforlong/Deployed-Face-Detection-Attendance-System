# Face-Detection-Attendance-System-Deployed
Face attendance system with the functions of taking, reading and compiling attendance deployed using streamlit.

Before running this, you have to make a mysql database named attendance and create a table named attendance inside it with columns 'EventDate'(type: datetime), Name(type: varchar) and Attendance(type: varchar).

After installling the necessary modules, after opening cmd on the destination folder of the main python files, run `streamlit run face_gui.py`

That's all!


Peace out (°꒳°)
